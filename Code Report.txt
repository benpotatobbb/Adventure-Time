Code Report: Adventure Time Simulation
Overview
The provided Python script (AhmedAmeen_2405045037_BasicProgrammingFinals_DGD1.py) implements a text-based simulation set in the Adventure Time universe. It features a robust OOP structure, a command-line interface, and a shop system, with support for random events, quests, and persistent logging. This report evaluates the code's structure, functionality, strengths, and areas for improvement.
Code Structure
The code is organized into several key components:

Custom Exceptions:

AdventureError: Base exception for general errors.
CharacterNotFoundError: For invalid character names.
InsufficientFundsError: For insufficient gold in shop purchases.
These provide clear error handling and improve user experience.


Character Classes:

Base Character class with attributes (name, health, strength, gold, inventory) and methods (take_damage, add_item, spend_gold).
Subclasses (Hero, Princess, Villain, Shopkeeper) implement polymorphism with unique methods (attack, heal, taunt, offer_deal).
Inheritance is used effectively to share common functionality.


GoosesShop Class:

Manages a shop with items and their effects (e.g., increasing strength or health).
Uses lambda functions for item effects, allowing flexible attribute modifications.
Provides a display_items method and fun rhymes for immersion.


AdventureSimulation Class:

Orchestrates the game loop, character management, and command parsing.
Includes methods for random events, quests, logging, and command validation.
Uses case-insensitive lookups for characters and items.


Functional Programming:

Utilizes reduce for team strength calculation and map for applying random events.
Employs random, datetime, json, re, collections, and itertools for various functionalities.



Functionality

Gameplay: Players interact via commands like attack, heal, buy, and quest. The system supports a variety of characters and actions, with clear feedback.
Shop System: Items have distinct effects, and purchases are validated for sufficient funds.
Event System: Random events add unpredictability, affecting all characters simultaneously.
Logging: Events are saved to adventure_log.json and can be loaded, though loading is not fully integrated into gameplay.
Command Parsing: Uses regex for robust, case-insensitive command validation, supporting multi-word names (e.g., "Princess Bubblegum").

Strengths

OOP Design: The use of inheritance and polymorphism is well-executed, making the code modular and extensible.
Error Handling: Custom exceptions provide clear feedback for invalid actions, enhancing user experience.
Immersive Elements: Character-specific abilities, shop rhymes, and quests reflect the Adventure Time theme, adding engagement.
Flexibility: Case-insensitive name matching and regex-based command parsing handle complex inputs robustly.
Persistence: JSON logging ensures game events are saved, though loading is underutilized.

Areas for Improvement

File I/O in Browser Context:
The code uses file operations (open, json.dump, json.load) for logging, which is incompatible with browser-based environments like Pyodide. For browser compatibility, consider alternative storage (e.g., in-memory logs or localStorage).


Log Loading Integration:
The load_log method is implemented but not used in run_simulation. Integrating log loading on startup could enhance continuity.


Event System Balance:
Random events apply to all characters simultaneously, which may lead to unbalanced outcomes (e.g., all characters taking damage). Consider limiting events to specific characters or teams.


Shop Effect Clarity:
Some shop item effects (e.g., "Weird Gizmo") return strings that are appended to the output, which can be inconsistent. Standardizing effect outputs or separating side effects could improve clarity.


Input Validation:
While command parsing is robust, additional validation (e.g., preventing negative damage or ensuring unique character names) could prevent edge cases.


Testing:
The code lacks unit tests, which would help verify functionality for edge cases (e.g., zero health, empty inventory).



Recommendations

Browser Compatibility:
Replace file I/O with in-memory storage or a browser-compatible alternative for Pyodide support.
Example: Store logs in a list and provide a command to view them.


Enhanced Logging:
Load the log on startup and display past events or allow players to resume quests.


Balanced Events:
Introduce event filters (e.g., only affect Hero characters) or allow players to choose event targets.


Shop Effect Standardization:
Refactor item effects to return consistent results (e.g., None for no message) and handle output in buy_item.


Unit Tests:
Add tests for character actions, shop purchases, and event outcomes using a framework like unittest.


Game Progression:
Add a quest completion mechanism or a win/lose condition to give the simulation a clear goal.



Conclusion
The Adventure Time Simulation is a well-structured, engaging project that effectively uses OOP and Python's standard libraries to create an interactive game. Its strengths lie in its thematic immersion, robust error handling, and modular design. Addressing file I/O compatibility, enhancing log integration, and balancing gameplay mechanics would further improve its functionality and user experience.
